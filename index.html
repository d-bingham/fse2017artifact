	<h1>The Care and Feeding of Wild-Caught Mutants -- Artifact</h1>

	This artifact provides the toolchain used in the paper and implements a
	small subset of the experimentation performed in the paper; the subset used 
	is necessary for artifact submission as the
	experiment as performed for the paper required tens of thousands of hours
	of processor time (and as such was executed on a high-throughput computing
	platform).

	<h2>Important files and directories</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="paper.pdf">The Care and Feeding of Wild-Caught Mutants</a> - The paper as submitted</li>
		<li><a href="wcm_demo.mp4">Wild-Caught Mutant Demo video</a> - A narrated video showing a brief demo of the toolchain</li>
		<li><a href="mutrun.sh">mutrun.sh</a> - A bash script which executes a subset of the experiment</li>
		<li><a href="code">code</a> - Source code for the Wild-Caught Mutants toolchain</li>
		<li><a href="github_scrape">github_scrape</a> - A subset of the source 
				control repository revision histories utilized in the experiment (specifically, the Linux kernal revision history is omitted for space and time concerns)</li>
		<li><a href="Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> - A Dockerfile which, when built, compiles the toolchain and runs the experiment subset</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Instructions for use</h2>

	<p>The toolchain (mutgen and mutins) can be built from the <a href="code">code</a> directory with make.</p>
	<p>The experimental subset (which builds the toolchain, harvests a set of mutants, and
		performs a subset of the paper's experimentation) is performed by the 
		<a href="mutrun.sh">mutrun.sh</a> script.  The experimental subset 
		performed by this script is chosen to take roughly half an hour on
		typical desktop hardware.</p>
	<p>A <a href="Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> is provided to automate the 
		process of executing the experimental subset.  Building the Docker
		instance from the Dockerfile will automatically run the experiment script 
		and display the results.</p>

	<h2>Note!</h2>
		We have noticed some unusual behavior with the test suites when using gcc 6.  If you have such a compiler version, please run the Docker version of the artifact.

	<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>This artifact is designed to provide both the tools developed for the paper and an
	example of the experiment.</p>
<p>Due to the sheer size of the experimentation performed for the paper, it is not
	feasible to have the artifact duplicate these; we provide a subset of both the 
	corpus to harvest a set of mutants from, and a randomly selected subset of 
	mutation operators to insert into the system under test.

	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>As the test suites used to calculate the Am(S) score for the experiment
			are generated randomly, the Am(S) score provided at the end of the 
			experiment can vary from run to run.
		</li>
		<li>The toolchain has been evolving steadily since the initial submission
			of the paper; as a result, this artifact shows significant improvements
			in both compilation rate and Am(S) scores (note that we consider
			<em>lower</em> Am(S) scores to be more desirable)
			over the experimental results reported in the paper.
		</li>
		<li>
			This artifact omits an idiomization pass and identifier shifts and
			instead focuses entirely on syntactic mutation operators due to 
			time constraints for running the artifact.
		</li>
	</ul>
